# Introduction
This project is to explore two things in general:
1. HDB resale price data - exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to find insights.
2. Modelling to predict HDB resale price as well as a classification model to infer flat type.

The purpose of this project is mainly for myself to explore regression models and also classification models.

The dataset for this case study was sourced from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices) and includes data for the years below:
- 1990-1999
- 2000-Feb 2012
- Mar 2012-Dec 2014
- Jan 2015-Dec 2016
- Jan 2017 onwards

In this repo, you will find the following:
1. resale-flat-prices (folder): this folder contains all the relevant data for this project.
2. [HDB Resale Price Analysis and Prediction_v1.ipynb](https://github.com/chngchn/HDBResalePriceAnalysis/blob/master/HDB%20Resale%20Price%20Analysis%20and%20Prediction_v1.ipynb): the Jupyter notebook containing relevant codes and analysis.
3. checkingresale.csv: a CSV file used to store hypothetical value for resale price prediction.
